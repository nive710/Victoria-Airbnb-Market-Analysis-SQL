# Data Validation & Preparation

Before performing business analysis, the dataset was validated, profiled, and cleaned to ensure analytical reliability and data quality.

---

### Dataset Validation

**Highlights**

- **2,341 Hosts**
- **29 Neighborhoods**
- **4 Room Types**

---

### Duplicate Check

![](Data_Preparation/screenshots/duplicate_count.PNG)

**Result**

✅ No duplicate listing IDs were found, confirming record uniqueness.

---

### Missing Value Assessment

![](Data_Preparation/screenshots/missing_value_analysis.PNG)

**Findings**

- **3,396** Total Listings
- **514** Missing Price values
- **514** Missing Revenue values
- **75** Missing Bedroom values

Price and Revenue were missing together for the same listings, making those records unsuitable for revenue analysis.
